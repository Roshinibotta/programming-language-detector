# 🚀 Programming Language Detector

A web application that detects the **programming language of a given code snippet** and provides additional analysis such as code explanation, syntax checking, and code statistics.

This project combines **Machine Learning and Web Development** to create an interactive tool for analyzing code snippets.

---

# 📌 Features

🔍 **Programming Language Detection**
Detects the programming language from a pasted code snippet.

💡 **Code Explanation**
Provides a simple explanation of what the code is doing.

🐞 **Syntax Error Detection**
Checks for possible syntax errors in the code.

📊 **Code Statistics**
Shows useful information about the code such as:

* Number of lines
* Characters
* Words
* Loops
* Functions

🎨 **Interactive User Interface**
A clean and modern interface built using HTML and CSS.
